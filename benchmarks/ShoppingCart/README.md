# Shopping Cart API

This application provides a serverless API for managing a shopping cart using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. It consists of two main functions:

1. Add to Cart (Node.js): Allows users to add products to their cart.
2. Checkout Cart (Python): Processes the checkout operation for a user's cart.


The benchmark is originally from [AWS Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-shopping-cart).
